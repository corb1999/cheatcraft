# cheatcraft
A potluck of R code snippets and small helper functions. Little cheat-codes to make data analysis projects a tiny bit easier. Also an opportunity to practice R coding and git.

What is in here?
- Starter Kits: templates for analysis scripts and other boilerplate starters
- Utilities: Misc helpful snippets or functions that can be copy-pasted rather than rewritten in different projects
